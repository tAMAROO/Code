TODO list:
---
    
  1.  Insert a button to browse for files within the system to pull a hash from.
    
  2.  Find a way to pick which has I would like to use (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512). (I do have a way for a drop down menu but ran into some issues.)
    
  3.  Find a way to take chosen hash from drop down menu and run that has against the file, and insert the hash from file into the first entry box.
    
  4. Make sure while pulling the has it isn't overloading the memory.
    
  5.  Find a way to show a different label output for if entery box 1 is empty and entry box 2 is empty and also if both entry boxes are empty.(I figured out a way to show
    
  6.  if entrybox1 is empty but not entrybox2 and vice versa, but not the way if they are both empty.
    
  7.  I am sure I will find more things to add to it.
