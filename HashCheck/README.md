# HashCheck

A python program written using tkinter to compare two strings and see if they match at its most basic form.

Use:

I would use this program to check file hashes pulled from downloads and the site or other source it came from to compare the two hashes.  This way I do not have to use a text editor and physically check myself.

Note:

This is not pretty and I am sure there are WAY better ways to do the same thing.
