========================== Update 4/19/2024 ===========================
-Added new images for the weather conditions.
-Added more conditions to the list.
-Sorted weather conditions to better align with the new images.
-Renamed time string to gTime for the time scraped from google.
-Added new lists: sunCover, tStorm, colderRain
-Added title string that will now show the City, State or Country 
information from google in output.
-Cleaned up the comments to cut down on clutter.

------------------------------ TODO ----------------------------------
-I would like to find a way to compare the time scraped from google and
use that to change the wallpaper to a night mode if it is night in the
searched city,town,state,country.
